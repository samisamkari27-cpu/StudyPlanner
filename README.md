About the project

This project is based on evidence from cognitive and educational psychology showing that effective learning depends on matching the learning goal (memorization, understanding, or application) with the appropriate level of cognitive processing, rather than matching instruction to so-called learning styles.

1- How to determine your study approach

This system does not assume that students have a fixed learning style.
Instead, it identifies the most effective study approach based on the learning goal and the type of cognitive processing required by the material.

You will answer a short set of questions to determine what the subject mainly requires from you:

Memorization
When the goal is to remember facts, definitions, formulas, terminology, or other basic information.

Understanding
When the goal is to explain concepts, understand relationships, and reason about ideas rather than simply recall information.

Application
When the goal is to solve problems, apply concepts to new situations, or perform practical tasks.

Research in cognitive and educational psychology shows that learning outcomes depend on the depth of processing used during study.
Deeper processing, such as understanding and application, leads to stronger and longer-lasting learning than surface-level repetition.

Based on your answers, the system matches your learning goal with an evidence-based study approach that is most likely to support effective learning.
